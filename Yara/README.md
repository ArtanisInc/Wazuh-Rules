# YARA Integration
> YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a. rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean expression which determine its logic.

_Must have YARA installed on your endpoints_



## [YARA Github](https://github.com/virustotal/yara)
Set your YARA scan to run at set intervals by incorporating a Cronjob to run the yara_full_scan.sh script.
